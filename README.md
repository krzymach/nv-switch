# nv-switch
Switch between Nvidia and Intel GPU with Nvidia PRIME (Optimus equivalent for Linux)

## Requirements :
* Laptop with Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU (Optimus) *- Tested on MSI GE60-0NC*
* Linux distribution *- Tested on Linux Mint 18*
* Up-to-date Nvidia proprietary driver *- Tested on nvidia-361* 
* Root/sudo permissions

## Instructions :
Execute the shell script or create a keybord shorcut to launch the script directly (like the "turbo" button on MSI laptops for instance). You can choose *nv-switch.sh* to confirm the choice after launching the script or you can choose "nv-switch_no-prompt.sh" to switch the gpu and logout directly (the best choice for a keybord shortcut)

## Languages :
* FR
* EN (TODO)
* Your language here ?
 
## Contribution :
If you want to translate the script, copy an existing folder (preferably fr or en) and rename the new folder with your language code ( [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) )
Translate the scripts, test it if you can and finally submit your Pull request.
