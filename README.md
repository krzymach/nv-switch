# nv-switch
Switch between Nvidia and Intel GPU with Nvidia PRIME (Linux)

## Instructions :
Execute the script directly or create a keybord shorcut to launch the script (like the "turbo" button on MSI laptops for instance)

## Languages :
* FR
* EN (TODO)
* Your language here ?
 
## Contribution :
If you want to translate the script, copy an existing folder (preferably fr or en) and rename the new folder with your language code ( [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) )
Translate the scripts, test it if you can and finally submit your Pull request.
